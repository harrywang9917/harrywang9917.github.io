**Hello! 👋 I'm Harry.**


Currently, a final-year PhD student at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/), where I study [Bayesian statistics](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/bayesian-inference/index.html). 

My research focuses on [Bayesian Nonparametrics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/teaching/npbayes/mlss2011F.pdf) for detecting prevalent clusters and [Uncertainty Quantification](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20250006412/downloads/NESC_Academy_Intro_to_UQ_2025-06-25.pdf). I also work on distributed and parallel computing for large-scale [Bayesian inference](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=sml/Bayes.pdf).

I care about making complex ideas accessible and using mathematics to solve meaningful problems, helping connect rigor with real-world impact.

While waiting for my [MCMC](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-016-1015-8?wt_mc=Other.Other.8.CON1172.PSBR%20VSI%20Art09%20&%20utm_medium=other%20&%20utm_source=other%20&%20utm_content=2062018%20&%20utm_campaign=8_ago1936_psbr%20vsi%20art09#Abs1) to converge, you’ll often find me sipping coffee and contemplating the Scottish weather.

Trying my best not to be a $\frac{d^3 x}{d t^3}$ (jerk)!
